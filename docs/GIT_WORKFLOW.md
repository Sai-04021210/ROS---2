## Collaboration Guidelines

### Code Review Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement changes
3. Write tests
4. Update documentation
5. Create pull request
6. Code review
7. Merge to main

### Quality Standards
- All code must pass tests
- Documentation must be updated
- Commit messages must be descriptive
- Code must follow ROS 2 standards

This workflow ensures systematic development with proper version control throughout the January-March 2025 timeline.
